# MultiverseMagic
multiverse.py is a code that leverages quantum computing to scenarios in alternate universes based on historical events The script uses Qiskit, open-source quantum computing  to create a quantum circuit and simulate the multiverse possibilities. 
# Quantum Multiverse

This Python script, `multiverse.py`, uses quantum computing to explore alternate realities based on historical events from a given date.

## Features

- Fetches historical events, births, and deaths from the specified date.
- Uses Qiskit, an open-source quantum computing framework, to create a quantum circuit.
- Generates different scenarios for five universes, including our own.
- Presents a colorful and engaging user interface.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository https://github.com/CodingCosmic/MultiverseMagic 

cd MultiverseMagic 

or download the `multiverse.py` script.
2. Install Qiskit and other required dependencies: via pip istall qiskit pip install random pip install requests 



2. Follow the prompts to input a specific date.
3. The script will fetch historical events from that date and generate different scenarios in alternate universes.
